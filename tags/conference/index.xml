We&amp;rsquo;ve gone out of our way to reflect this feeling at the conference. We have engrossing keynotes, well-researched talks, hands-on pre-conference workshops, hallway tracks, and whatnot!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list of what to expect! What&amp;rsquo;s cooking in Keynotes? We have Diego Molina kicking things off with &amp;lsquo;Selenium: State of the Union&amp;rsquo; where he will talk about all things Selenium, including the project, the code, and the community.</description></item><item><title>SeleniumConf Chicago 2023 Speakers Announced</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/seleniumconf-chicago-2023-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2022/seleniumconf-chicago-2023-update/</guid><description>As many of you know, the Selenium Conference returns to an in-person event next March 28-30, 2023 in Chicago, IL.
